      "description": "The \"Start from Scratch\" button in the New Ticket dropdown does not work on macOS.\n\n## Root Cause Analysis\n\nThe `terminal-utils.ts` file only includes Linux terminal emulators in its `ALLOWED_TERMINALS` list. macOS-native terminals are missing:\n\n**Currently supported (cross-platform only):**\n- ghostty, alacritty, kitty (would work if installed)\n- gnome-terminal, konsole, xfce4-terminal, etc. (Linux only)\n\n**Missing macOS terminals:**\n- Terminal.app (built-in macOS terminal)\n- iTerm2 (popular third-party terminal)\n- Warp (modern terminal)\n\n## Additional Issues\n\n1. **No error feedback** - The code has `// TODO: Show error toast` but errors are only logged to console\n2. **GUI app launching** - Even with Ghostty installed, launching GUI apps from a web server process on macOS may have sandbox/permission issues\n\n## Acceptance Criteria\n\n- [ ] Add macOS Terminal.app support using `open -a Terminal` command pattern\n- [ ] Add iTerm2 support\n- [ ] Add Warp support  \n- [ ] Show error toast when terminal launch fails\n- [ ] Test on macOS with various terminal configurations",

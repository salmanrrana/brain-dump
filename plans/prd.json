Shell prompt visible\n2. Working directory set to project path\n3. Claude Code launched with ticket context\n4.

Current command:\n```\nghostty --working-directory=\"${projectPath}\" -e bash -c '${claudeCommand}; exec bash'\n```\n\nGhostty may not support the `-e` flag the same way other terminals do, or the command escaping is breaking the shell execution.\n\n## Acceptance Criteria\n- [ ] Terminal opens with visible shell prompt\n- [ ] Working directory is correct\n- [ ] Claude Code launches with context\n- [ ] Terminal remains interactive after Claude exits\n\n## Technical Notes\n- File: `src/api/terminal.ts`\n- Function: `buildTerminalCommand()` case for \"ghostty\"\n- Need to verify Ghostty's CLI syntax for running commands",

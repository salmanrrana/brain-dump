      "description": "Create a Claude Code hook that automatically triggers code review agents after completing a task.\n\n## Background\nWe have created VS Code agents (@code-reviewer, @code-simplifier) with handoffs for automated review workflows. We need the equivalent automation for Claude Code using hooks.\n\n## Requirements\n- Create a hook (Stop or PostToolUse) that triggers after task completion\n- The hook should run the pr-review-toolkit agents (code-reviewer, silent-failure-hunter)\n- Results should be displayed to the user\n- Optionally trigger code-simplifier for cleanup\n\n## Acceptance Criteria\n- [x] Hook triggers automatically when a coding task completes\n- [x] Review results are shown to the user\n- [x] Hook can be enabled/disabled via configuration\n- [x] Documentation updated with hook setup instructions\n\n## Technical Notes\n- Hook types to consider: Stop, SubagentStop, or PostToolUse\n- May need to detect \"task completion\" vs regular tool use\n- Consider using the Task tool to spawn review agents",

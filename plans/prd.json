      "description": "## Task\nImplement automatic one-time migration from old `~/.brain-dump/` to new XDG paths.\n\n## Migration Steps\n1. Check if legacy `~/.brain-dump/` exists\n2. Check if new XDG location already has data\n3. If legacy exists and XDG empty:\n   - Copy database to new location\n   - Copy attachments to new location\n   - Create `.migrated` marker in legacy dir\n   - Log migration success\n4. If both exist, warn user and use XDG\n\n## Safety Measures\n- Never delete legacy data automatically\n- Create backup before migration\n- Verify database integrity after copy\n- Atomic operations where possible\n\n## Acceptance Criteria\n- [ ] Migration runs automatically on first start\n- [ ] Legacy data preserved (not deleted)\n- [ ] Migration only happens once\n- [ ] Error handling for failed migrations\n- [ ] User informed of migration via log\n\n## File to Create\n`src/lib/migration.ts`",

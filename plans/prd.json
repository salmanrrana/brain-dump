Use `workflow` `start-epic` to create the shared branch before starting work on any ticket.\n\n---\n\n# Plan: Projects Home Page\n\n## Context\n\nCurrently Brain Dump drops users directly onto a kanban board showing all tickets — which gets overwhelming as projects grow. This change introduces a clean **Projects home page** as the landing page, with drill-down into epics, providing a structured entry: **Projects → Epics → Filtered Kanban Board**.\n\n## Route Changes\n\n| Before | After |\n|--------|-------|\n| `/` → Kanban board | `/` → Projects home page |\n| _(none)_ | `/board` → Kanban board (moved from `/`) |\n| _(none)_ | `/projects/$projectId` → Project detail (epic list) |\n\nThe sidebar \"Projects\" icon (shortcut 3) **keeps** its current behavior (opens slide-out ProjectsPanel). The \"Board\" icon (shortcut 2) updates to point to `/board`. \n\n## Steps\n\n### 1. Move kanban board from `/` to `/board`\n\n- **Create** `src/routes/board.tsx` — copy entire contents of current `src/routes/index.tsx`, change route path to `/board`\n- **Update** `src/routes/index.tsx` — replace with new Projects home (step 3)\n\n### 2. Update internal navigations from `/` to `/board`\n\nThese files navigate to `/` expecting the board — update to `/board`:\n\n| File | Line | Change |\n|------|------|--------|\n| `src/routes/dashboard.tsx` | 112 | `navigate({ to: \"/board\" })` |\n| `src/routes/ticket.$id.tsx` | 60, 330 | `router.navigate({ to: \"/board\" })` |\n| `src/components/AppLayout.tsx` | 367 | `navigate({ to: \"/board\" })` |\n\n### 3. Create Projects home page (`/`)\n\n**New file:** `src/routes/index.tsx`\n\n- Uses `useProjectsWithAIActivity()` hook (already exists in `src/lib/hooks/projects.ts`)\n- Renders a responsive grid of project cards\n- Each card shows: project name, path (truncated), epic count, ticket stats, AI activity glow\n- Click a card → navigate to `/projects/$projectId`\n- Empty state with \"Add Project\" CTA\n- Header with \"Projects\" title + \"New Project\" button (reuse existing `ProjectModal`)\n\n**New file:** `src/components/projects/ProjectCard.tsx`\n\n- Card component for the grid\n- Props: project data (ProjectWithAIActivity), onClick, onEdit\n- Shows color accent from `project.color`\n- AI glow animation when `hasActiveAI` (reuse existing keyframes from ProjectsPanel)\n- \"View All Tickets\" secondary action → navigate to `/board?project=X`\n\n### 4. Create Project detail page (`/projects/$projectId`)\n\n**New file:** `src/routes/projects.$projectId.tsx`\n\n- Fetches project from `useProjects()` by matching `projectId` param\n- Shows project header (name, path, color) with back navigation to `/`\n- Lists epics using existing `EpicListItem` component from `src/components/navigation/EpicListItem.tsx`\n- Click epic → navigate to `/board?project=X&epic=Y` (uses existing URL filter system)\n- \"View All Tickets\" button → navigate to `/board?project=X`\n- \"Add Epic\" button (reuse existing epic creation modal)\n- Empty state: \"No epics yet — create your first epic to organize your tickets\"\n- Epic ticket counts via `useTickets` or a lightweight count query\n\n### 5. Update sidebar navigation\n\n**Modify** `src/components/navigation/IconSidebar.tsx`:\n- Change Board nav item path from `\"/\"` to `\"/board\"`\n- Add new \"Home\" nav item at position 0 with path `\"/\"`  and a Home icon\n- Update shortcut keys: Home=1, Dashboard=2, Board=3, Projects=4(panel), Settings=5\n\n**OR** simpler approach — keep 4 items, just update Board path:\n- Dashboard (1) → `/dashboard`\n- Board (2) → `/board`\n- Projects (3) → slide-out panel (unchanged)\n- Settings (4) → modal (unchanged)\n\nUsers reach the home page by clicking the app logo/brand or navigating to `/` directly. The sidebar doesn't need a dedicated home item if the header has one.\n\n### 6. Add home navigation affordance\n\nAdd a clickable logo/brand element in the header (`src/components/layout/AppHeader.tsx`) that navigates to `/` (projects home). This gives users a consistent way back to the projects overview.\n\n## Key Files\n\n| File | Action | Purpose |\n|------|--------|---------|\n| `src/routes/board.tsx` | Create | New board route (moved from index) |\n| `src/routes/index.tsx` | Rewrite | New projects home page |\n| `src/routes/projects.$projectId.tsx` | Create | Project detail with epic list |\n| `src/components/projects/ProjectCard.tsx` | Create | Project card for grid |\n| `src/components/navigation/IconSidebar.tsx` | Modify | Update Board path to `/board` |\n| `src/components/layout/AppHeader.tsx` | Modify | Add home link on logo/brand |\n| `src/routes/dashboard.tsx` | Modify | Update nav to `/board` |\n| `src/routes/ticket.$id.tsx` | Modify | Update nav to `/board` |\n| `src/components/AppLayout.tsx` | Modify | Update nav to `/board` |\n\n## Reusable Existing Code\n\n- **`useProjectsWithAIActivity()`** — `src/lib/hooks/projects.ts` — projects + AI glow data\n- **`useProjects()`** — `src/lib/hooks/projects.ts` — projects with epics\n- **`EpicListItem`** — `src/components/navigation/EpicListItem.tsx` — compact epic row with actions\n- **`EpicDrillInView`** — `src/components/navigation/EpicDrillInView.tsx` — epic list with search/back nav (reference for layout)\n- **`ProjectModal`** — existing modal for creating/editing projects\n- **`EpicModal`** — existing modal for creating/editing epics\n- **URL filter system** — `useFiltersWithUrl()` in `src/lib/filter-hooks.ts` — board already reads `?project=X&epic=Y`\n- **AI glow keyframes** — from ProjectsPanel CSS\n\n## Verification\n\n1. `pnpm type-check` — no type errors\n2. `pnpm lint` — no lint errors\n3. `pnpm test` — existing tests pass\n4. Manual testing:\n   - Navigate to `/` → see project cards\n   - Click project → see epic list at `/projects/:id`\n   - Click epic → board opens at `/board?project=X&epic=Y` with filtered tickets\n   - Click \"View All Tickets\" → board opens at `/board?project=X`\n   - Sidebar Board icon → goes to `/board`\n   - Sidebar Projects icon → opens slide-out panel (unchanged)\n   - Dashboard \"back\" nav → goes to `/board`\n   - Browser back/forward works across all transitions\n   - Empty state renders when no projects exist\n   - Empty epic state renders when project has no epics",

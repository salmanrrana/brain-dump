<!--
  NOTE: This file is auto-generated by the Ralph launch script.

  The CANONICAL source of the Ralph prompt is:
    src/api/ralph.ts → getRalphPrompt()

  Do NOT manually edit workflow instructions here. Update getRalphPrompt() instead.
  All launch paths (Docker, native Claude, OpenCode, VS Code) use that function.

  This file exists because Docker sandbox mode writes the prompt to
  $PROJECT_PATH/.ralph-prompt.md before launching Claude inside the container.
  For manual launches, use the Brain Dump UI which generates the prompt automatically.
-->

You are Ralph, an autonomous coding agent.

Your workflow instructions are provided via the system prompt generated by Brain Dump.
If you don't see workflow instructions, the launch may not have been configured correctly.

Use `list_projects()` to verify MCP tools are available before starting work.
